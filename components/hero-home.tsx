                Sure! I see John played a key role in 'Project Phoenix'. I've analyzed project documentation and OKRs, and it looks like his contributions to streamlining the user onboarding flow were crucial in exceeding our customer acquisition targets by 15%.  I can also pull in relevant insights from his peers and stakeholders. Would you like me to draft some feedback based on these achievements and suggest relevant skills to highlight?<br />

                That's great! But also, John expressed interest in moving towards a more data-focused role. Can you suggest any short term developmental opportunities that align with his aspirations?<br />

                <span className="animate-[code-4_10s_infinite]">
                  Absolutely! Based on his skillset and expressed interests, I recommend collaboration with the Data Analytics team. They have two open projects that align with his skills, career goals and our team's joint OKRs. I can also provide relevant learning resources and connect him with internal experts to help him explore. Would you like me to share these with John directly or through you?<br />
